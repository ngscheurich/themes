# Themes

Herein is a repository of wondrous colors, carefully—or perhaps not so carefully—arranged in various configurations. A handful of computer programs that I use draw upon these palettes to present a visually unified computer (terminal emulator) interface.

## Quickstart

Use the initialization script to clone this repo to your [`XDG_DATA_HOME`] directory. You are abiding by the XDG Base Directory Specification, yeah?

```sh
bash -c "$(curl -fsLS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ngscheurich/themes/main/init.sh)"
```
